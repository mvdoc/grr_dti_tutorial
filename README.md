# Using dipy to explore Diffusion Weighted Imaging and Tractography

Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello & Manon de Villemejane

------
This repository contains a jupyter notebook with a quick tutorial on how to use [`dipy`](http://www.nipy.org/dipy) to perform tractography on diffusion weighted imaging.

We presented this tutorial during the 2017 Psychological & Brain Science "Day of Graduate Research Roundtable" at Dartmouth College. It's very much an exploration, and care should be taken before using any of these methods in real researchâ€”know thy methods. However, I believe we learned a lot about the methods by messing around. We hope it will be helpful for you as well.



## Required packages

You should need only `dipy` to run the analyses, and [`datalad`](http://www.datalad.org) to download the data. Some steps might require a working copy of FSL or your favourite neuroimaging toolbox to perform skull stripping and tissue segmentation.

We provide a conda [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file that allows you to re-create the conda environment we used to run this tutorial. You should be able to create it using
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
It will be big because it's based on anaconda, so it will install a lot of packages that this tutorial doesn't use. For more information on how to manage conda environment, check this page: https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html
